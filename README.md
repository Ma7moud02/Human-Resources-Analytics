## Introduction
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of employee data to derive actionable insights into workforce dynamics, satisfaction metrics, and attrition trends. Leveraging tools like Power BI and DAX, the project culminates in an interactive dashboard designed to support HR decision-making with key metrics and trends.

üéØ **Objective**
The primary goal of this project was to perform a detailed analysis of employee data, focusing on several key aspects:

- **Understand Workforce Distribution**: Analyze demographics, roles, and regional employee concentration.
- **Track Attrition Trends**: Identify patterns in attrition and factors influencing employee turnover.
- **Evaluate Satisfaction Metrics**: Measure and analyze job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, and work-life balance.
- **Provide Actionable Insights**: Use data visualization to enable informed decision-making for retention strategies and organizational improvements.

## Overview
üìä This README file documents the technical journey of the HR Analytics project, developed during a data camp competition. The project earned second place in the competition and showcases advanced data analysis and visualization techniques using Power BI. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the process, methodologies, and outcomes.

## Project Background
üìà The competition involved analyzing a dataset of employees in a company to derive actionable insights about HR metrics such as satisfaction levels, attrition rates, and performance evaluations. The primary goals were:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Implement an effective data modeling strategy.
- Build insightful dashboards using Power BI.

## Data Exploration
üîç The dataset provided contained detailed information about employees, including demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and performance metrics. Below is the data dictionary summarizing the key tables and fields:

### Key Tables
- **Employee**: Contains demographic and job-related data.
- **Performance**: Tracks performance review metrics.
- **Satisfied Level**: Maps satisfaction levels to descriptive categories.
- **Rating Level**: Maps performance ratings to descriptive categories.

For more details, refer to the attached data dictionary.

## Data Modeling
üìê After EDA, a snowflake schema was chosen for the data model as it allowed for:

- Efficient normalization of related dimensions.
- Simplified maintenance and flexibility for complex queries.

The schema design includes fact and dimension tables linked appropriately to ensure a clear and logical representation of the data.

### DimDate Table
üìÖ A custom date table was created to facilitate time-based analysis. The table includes fields for fiscal year, month, quarter, and week calculations, providing granular control over temporal data. Below is the DAX formula used:

```DAX
DimDate = 
VAR _minYear = YEAR(MIN(DimEmployee[HireDate]))
VAR _maxYear = YEAR(MAX(DimEmployee[HireDate]))
VAR _fiscalStart = 4 

RETURN
ADDCOLUMNS(

    CALENDAR(

                DATE(_minYear,1,1),

                DATE(_maxYear,12,31)

),

"Year",YEAR([Date]),
"Year Start",DATE( YEAR([Date]),1,1),
"YearEnd",DATE( YEAR([Date]),12,31),
"MonthNumber",MONTH([Date]),
"MonthStart",DATE( YEAR([Date]), MONTH([Date]), 1),
"MonthEnd",EOMONTH([Date],0),
"DaysInMonth",DATEDIFF(DATE( YEAR([Date]), MONTH([Date]), 1),EOMONTH([Date],0),DAY)+1,
"YearMonthNumber",INT(FORMAT([Date],"YYYYMM")),
"YearMonthName",FORMAT([Date],"YYYY-MMM"),
"DayNumber",DAY([Date]),
"DayName",FORMAT([Date],"DDDD"),
"DayNameShort",FORMAT([Date],"DDD"),
"DayOfWeek",WEEKDAY([Date]),
"MonthName",FORMAT([Date],"MMMM"),
"MonthNameShort",FORMAT([Date],"MMM"),
"Quarter",QUARTER([Date]),
"QuarterName","Q"&FORMAT([Date],"Q"),
"YearQuarterNumber",INT(FORMAT([Date],"YYYYQ")),
"YearQuarterName",FORMAT([Date],"YYYY")&" Q"&FORMAT([Date],"Q"),
"QuarterStart",DATE( YEAR([Date]), (QUARTER([Date])*3)-2, 1),
"QuarterEnd",EOMONTH(DATE( YEAR([Date]), QUARTER([Date])*3, 1),0),
"WeekNumber",WEEKNUM([Date]),
"WeekStart", [Date]-WEEKDAY([Date])+1,
"WeekEnd",[Date]+7-WEEKDAY([Date]),
"FiscalYear",if(_fiscalStart=1,YEAR([Date]),YEAR([Date])+ QUOTIENT(MONTH([Date])+ (13-_fiscalStart),13)),
"FiscalQuarter",QUARTER( DATE( YEAR([Date]),MOD( MONTH([Date])+ (13-_fiscalStart) -1 ,12) +1,1) ),
"FiscalMonth",MOD( MONTH([Date])+ (13-_fiscalStart) -1 ,12) +1
)
```

This table enhances reporting capabilities by aligning analysis with both calendar and fiscal periods.

## Key Measures
üî¢ Below are some of the key measures used in the project, along with their descriptions and DAX formulas:

### 1. % Attrition Rate
**Description**: Calculates the percentage of employees who have left the company.
```DAX
% Attrition Rate = 
COALESCE(DIVIDE([InactiveEmployees], [TotalEmployees], 0), 0)
```

### 2. Cumulative Active Employees
**Description**: Tracks the cumulative count of active employees over time.
```DAX
Cumulative Active Employees = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('DimEmployee'[EmployeeID]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('DimDate'[Year]),
        'DimDate'[Year] <= MAX('DimDate'[Year])
    ),
    'DimEmployee'[Attrition] = "No",
    USERELATIONSHIP(DimEmployee[HireDate], DimDate[Date])
)
```

### 3. Attrition Rate by Group
**Description**: Calculates the attrition rate for specific groups of employees.
```DAX
AttritionRateByGroup = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(
        COUNTROWS(dimEmployee),
        dimEmployee[Attrition] = "Yes"
    ),
    COUNTROWS(dimEmployee)
) * 100
```

### 4. Last Review Date
**Description**: Returns the most recent review date for an employee or indicates no review if unavailable.
```DAX
LastReviewDate = 
IF (
    MAX ( FactPerformanceRating[ReviewDate] ) = BLANK (),
    "No Review Yet",
    MAX ( FactPerformanceRating[ReviewDate] )
)
```

### 5. Avg Years at Company by Group
**Description**: Calculates the average years employees have spent at the company for specific groups.
```DAX
AvgYearsAtCompanyByGroup = 
AVERAGEX(
    SUMMARIZE(
        dimEmployee,
        dimEmployee[YearsAtCompany]
    ),
    dimEmployee[YearsAtCompany]
)
```

### 6. Avg Satisfaction by Group
**Description**: Computes the average job satisfaction for employee groups.
```DAX
AvgSatisfactionByGroup = 
AVERAGEX(
    SUMMARIZE(
        factPerformanceRating,
        factPerformanceRating[JobSatisfaction]
    ),
    factPerformanceRating[JobSatisfaction]
)
```
